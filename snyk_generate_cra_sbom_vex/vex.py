"""Derives a CycloneDX VEX document from each project's issue/ignore data (FR-9, FR-3, FR-4).

Open Risk #2 asked which API is authoritative for ignore-reason
metadata. Confirmed against the live OpenAPI spec
(https://api.snyk.io/rest/openapi/{api-version}) while building this
module: the REST issues endpoint's `attributes.ignored` is only a
boolean, and its `relationships.ignore` is an opaque {id, type:
"ignore"} reference with no path in this API version to fetch the
ignore's actual reason/expiry. That detail is only available from the
legacy v1 `GET /v1/org/{org}/project/{project}/ignores` endpoint, keyed
by issue ID, in the reasonType/reason/expires shape FR-3's mapping
table is written against -- so this module reads the vulnerability list
from the REST API and ignore reasons from the legacy v1 API.

VEX entries are cross-referenced to the aggregate SBOM via
MergeResult.component_lookup (built while aggregating, from the same
project-scoped package name/version each issue's `coordinates` report),
so VEX can only be derived once an aggregate SBOM exists (FR-3: "only
CycloneDX+JSON" aggregates have one).

Per FR-9a (v0.6), a vulnerability that affects more than one component
occurrence -- because the same underlying vulnerability surfaces as a
distinct per-project issue in every project a package appears in, and/or
FR-8 now keeps every duplicate occurrence rather than collapsing them --
is de-duplicated to exactly one vulnerability entry, listing every
affected occurrence in its `affects` array and an `snyk:occurrenceCount`
property. Grouping is keyed on the underlying vulnerability identifier
(CVE, or the Snyk vulnerability key as a fallback -- see
_preferred_vuln_id), never the per-project issue ID, since the issue ID
differs project to project for the same flaw (Open Risk #8). If the
resolved per-occurrence analysis states disagree (e.g. ignored in one
project but not another), the least-suppressed state wins (open/
unignored beats any ignored state) and the conflict is reported back to
the caller.

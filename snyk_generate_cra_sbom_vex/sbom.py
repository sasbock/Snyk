"""Fetches (FR-7) and aggregates (FR-8) per-project SBOM documents.

Per FR-1, only projects classified in-scope (Open Source/Container --
see resolvers/base.py) are fetched; others are skipped and logged in
debug mode rather than attempted. Per FR-14, a single project's fetch
failure is reported and the run continues by default; --fail-fast
aborts the whole run on the first one instead.

Aggregation (merge_sboms) is implemented for CycloneDX+JSON only -- the
format FR-7/FR-8 describe concretely. XML and SPDX SBOMs are still
fetched, but aggregating them is out of scope for now (each has a
meaningfully different merge story: XML needs its own parser, and SPDX
uses packages/relationships rather than components/dependencies) and is
reported back as a skip reason rather than attempted.

Per v0.6 of the requirements doc, aggregation no longer de-duplicates
components by purl (FR-8): every component occurrence from every
fetched SBOM is kept, each with its own unique bom-ref, so the same
library appearing in more than one project -- or more than once within
a single project -- appears that many times in the output. VEX
de-duplication of vulnerabilities *across* those occurrences (FR-9a) is
vex.py's job, using component_lookup below to find every occurrence a
given project-scoped (name, version) maps to.
